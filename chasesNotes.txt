notes:

	write tryRegisterOwner function
	+	Change sin to be char
	+	write sinExists function
	+	write create createPerson
		+ hight isnt an int
		+ weight isnt an int
		+ fix date prompt for correct format
		+ date isnt an int

	-	write registerOwner
		- Primary owner considerations?
		+ Check for vehicle already exisitng in database

	- Upon asking for owner SIN in registering vehicle incorrect person is returned
		+ write DBgetPersonName(SIN) - DBgetBirthday(SIN)
		- format birthday properly to return 

	- for retrieving people or vehicles from DB, perhaps consolidate to 1 function rather than 1 for each field


IN AT:
	- Should seller have to be Primary owner to sell vehicle (probably)

	



ISSUES:
	- checks and logic for owner being primary or not
