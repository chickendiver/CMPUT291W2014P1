notes:


ISSUES:
	- format display for birthday properly
	- Make sure that no-entry on yes/no defaults to yes
	- Add primary owner logic and necessary places
	- Create some kind of queueing system for transactions that quit halfway through
	- Drivers licence photo not working yet
	+ In auto transaction review logic that seller owns vehicle
		+ if new vehicle is created, register it to the seller immediately.
		+ if the seller does not own a vehicle that already exists, then they cannot sell it

	- Make sure SINs and VINs are case insensitive
	- Make some master exit key to stop getting stuck in infinite loops
	- Restriction table is not being touched for driving conditions

	- for search use joins for when people have no restrictions and stuff






Final stuff:
	Test up to possible test scenarios on eclass
