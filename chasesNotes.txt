notes:


ISSUES:
	- format display for birthday properly
	- Make sure that no-entry on yes/no defaults to yes
	- Add primary owner logic in necessary places
	- Create some kind of queueing system for transactions that quit halfway through
	- Drivers licence photo not working yet
	+ In auto transaction review logic that seller owns vehicle
		+ if new vehicle is created, register it to the seller immediately.
		+ if the seller does not own a vehicle that already exists, then they cannot sell it

	- Make sure SINs and VINs are case insensitive
	- Make some master exit key to stop getting stuck in infinite loops
	- Restriction table is not being touched for driving conditions

	- for search use joins for when people have no restrictions and stuff



Final stuff:
	Test up to possible test scenarios on eclass





Mar 19:

-	Make master escape character
-	Do a final check of stuck points

New Vehicle Registration:
	+	Make sure all data that goes to or from DB is uppercased
	+	Mare sure people's birthdays print properly
	- 	Sanatize input again
	-	Add way to just modify primary owners


Auto Transaction:
	-	looks like it all works, just check question and exit logic

Driver Licence Reg:
	-	Find way to add photo
	-	do full testing for other bugs


Violation Record:
	-	Make sure office is actually an officer
